#SenMLActuationResponseEntry:
type: object
description: A response entry for a SenML actuation.
  It responds using SenML syntax. Where each sensor or
  SenML parameter entry is reflected back with a
  [HTTP status code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes).

  The client may check each individual to get the result
  of the actuation. The optional `t`ime can be used to
  determin when the actuation did occur. It may have one or more
  virtual sensors if e.g. client cookie is provided then
  it is returned as a value under the name `urn:senml:cc`
  and the property `vs` is set as the input provided client
  cookie.

  This is for asynchrnonous APIs where responses are either polled
  or recieved asynchrnously e.g. via `MQTT` or `WebSocket`. Other 
  means of providing this is allowed such as a `HTTP` header or alike.
