#RequestEntry:
type: object
description: A single entry to adress one sensor or data element in a request or subscription.
  It follows the SenML semantics so a `bn` may be provided to prefix the `n` element and so on.
  Since this is a request entry all parameters are criterion to enable sensor readings and
  narrow the resultset. All are optional except for the `n` element. It is also possible to
  use this request to query historical data using a time reference acting as from time.

  This request should use the SenML defined mimetypes such as `application/senml+json`.
