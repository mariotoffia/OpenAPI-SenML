   <p>
   If either the Base Time or Time value is missing, the missing field
   is considered to have a value of zero.  The Base Time and Time values
   are added together to get a value representing the time of
   measurement.</p>
   <p>
   Values less than 268,435,456 (2**28) represent time relative to the
   current time.  That is, a time of zero indicates that the sensor does
   not know the absolute time and the measurement was made roughly
   "now".  A negative value indicates seconds in the past from roughly
   "now".  Positive values up to 2**28 indicate seconds in the future
   from "now".  An example for employing positive values would be
   actuation use, when the desired change should happen in the future,
   but the sender or the receiver does not have accurate time available.</p>
   <p>
   Values greater than or equal to 2**28 represent an absolute time
   relative to the Unix epoch (1970-01-01T00:00Z in UTC time), and the
   time is counted the same way as the Portable Operating System
   Interface (POSIX) "seconds since the epoch" [TIME_T].  Therefore, the
   smallest absolute Time value that can be expressed (2**28) is
   1978-07-04 21:24:16 UTC.</p>
   <p>
   Because Time values up to 2**28 are used for representing time
   relative to "now" and Time and Base Time are added together, care
   must be taken to ensure that the sum does not inadvertently reach
   2**28 (i.e., absolute time) when relative time was intended to be
   used.</p>
   <p>
   Obviously, SenML Records referenced to "now" are only useful within a
   specific communication context (e.g., based on information on when
   the SenML Pack, or a specific Record in a SenSML Stream, was sent) or
   together with some other context information that can be used for
   deriving a meaning of "now"; the expectation for any archival use is
   that they will be processed into UTC-referenced records before that
   context would cease to be available.  This specification deliberately
   leaves the accuracy of "now" very vague as it is determined by the
   overall systems that use SenML.  In a system where a sensor without
   wall-clock time sends a SenML Record with a time referenced to "now"
   over a high-speed RS-485 link to an embedded system with accurate
   time that resolves "now" based on the time of reception, the
   resulting time uncertainty could be within 1 ms.  At the other
   extreme, a deployment that sends SenML wind-speed readings over a
   Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite link from a mountain valley might
   have resulting reception Time values that are easily a dozen minutes
   off the actual time of the sensor reading, with the time uncertainty
   depending on satellite locations and conditions.</p>
