#Value:
type: boolean
example: true
description: If only one of the Base Sum or Sum value is present, the missing
   field is considered to have a value of zero.  The Base Sum and Sum
   values are added together to get the sum of measurement.  If neither
   the Base Sum nor the Sum is present, then the measurement does not
   have a Sum value.

   If the Base Value or Value is not present, the missing field(s) is
   considered to have a value of zero.  The Base Value and Value are
   added together to get the value of the measurement.

   Representing the statistical characteristics of measurements, such as
   accuracy, can be very complex.  Future specification may add new
   fields to provide better information about the statistical properties
   of the measurement.

   In summary, the structure of a SenML Record is laid out to support a
   single measurement per Record.  If multiple data values are measured
   at the same time (e.g., air pressure and altitude), they are best
   kept as separate Records linked through their Time value; this is
   even true when one of the data values is more "meta" than others
   (e.g., describes a condition that influences other measurements at
   the same time).
