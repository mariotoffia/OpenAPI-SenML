#Name:
type: string
example: 'fanspeed'
description: Name of the sensor / actuator or actuator parameter.
   The Name value is concatenated to the Base Name value to yield the
   name of the sensor.  The resulting concatenated name needs to
   uniquely identify and differentiate the sensor from all others.  The
   concatenated name MUST consist only of characters out of the set "A"
   to "Z", "a" to "z", and "0" to "9", as well as "-", ":", ".", "/",
   and "_"; furthermore, it MUST start with a character out of the set
   "A" to "Z", "a" to "z", or "0" to "9".  This restricted character set
   was chosen so that concatenated names can be used directly within
   various URI schemes (including segments of an HTTP path with no
   special encoding; note that a name that contains "/" characters maps
   into multiple URI path segments) and can be used directly in many
   databases and analytic systems.  [RFC5952] contains advice on
   encoding an IPv6 address in a name.  See Section 14 for privacy
   considerations that apply to the use of long-term stable unique
   identifiers.

   Although it is RECOMMENDED that concatenated names be represented as
   URIs [RFC3986] or URNs [RFC8141], the restricted character set
   specified above puts strict limits on the URI schemes and URN
   namespaces that can be used.  As a result, implementers need to take
   care in choosing the naming scheme for concatenated names, because
   such names both need to be unique and need to conform to the
   restricted character set.  One approach is to include a bit string
   that has guaranteed uniqueness (such as a 1-wire address [AN1796]).
   Some of the examples within this document use the device URN
   namespace as specified in [DEVICE-URN].  Universally Unique
   Identifiers (UUIDs) [RFC4122] are another way to generate a unique
   name.  However, the restricted character set does not allow the use
   of many URI schemes, such as the "tag" scheme [RFC4151] and the "ni"
   scheme [RFC6920], in names as such.  The use of URIs with characters
   incompatible with this set and possible mapping rules between the two
   are outside the scope of the present document.
